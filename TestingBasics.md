# Provided Resources

In most branches (i.e., for most course sections), you find the following folders in the repository branch:

- **`/code`**: Contains multiple subfolders with different code snapshots for this course section (also see [Using Code Snapshots](#using-code-snapshots))
- **`/slides`**: Contains section slides (if slides were shown / used in the section)
- **`/extra-files`**: Contains any extra files that were used (e.g., starting project code snapshots)


# Running The Provided Code

The provided code is primarily meant to be used for code comparisons (i.e., so that you can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors). 

But you can also run my project code by navigating into the respective code snapshots subfolder (i.e., a subfolder in the `/code` folder) and executing `npm install` followed by `npm test` there.
